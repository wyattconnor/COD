<h1>Campaign</h1>
<p>The campaign is the story mode of what Call of Duty your playing, depending on what game your playing would depend on what the setting is for the story. If your campaign's setting takes place a long time ago then that means that more than likely every other mode like zombies or multiplayer on whatever Call of Duty your playing would take place in that same time period as well. Some campaigns take place back in WW1, WW2, similar types of battles that our military fights now, and futuristic type battles with jetpacks and robots and other kinds of technology.</p>
