<h1>Zombies</h1>
<p>In most of the Call of Duty games there is a mode called Zombies. Zombies mode is trying to see how long you can survive from an unlimited amount of zombies that over time get stronger, faster, and more come every round for which you have to kill a certain amount of zombies in order to end whatever round your on. There are perks that you can buy that some are quite similar to multiplayer, these perks depending on what perk you buy will give you more health, a second life, faster reload speed, faster shooting speed, and many more with points that you earn by shooting and killing zombies or rebuilding barriers to slow down zombies. You can buy weapons off of the wall or you could spend 950 points out of the mystery box for a chance to get a good or bad weapon or a wonder weapon which is a special kind of weapon that will help you with high rounds. If your really in the mood for a challenge then you could try and find and beat the easter egg for whatever zombies map you want which an easter egg are hidden events that you have to find and complete in order that lead up to something big in the end.</p>
