<h1>Multiplayer</h1>
<p>Call of Duty is a first person shooter action video game series. In multiplayer you can choose what kind of weapons you want,  like if you want to go into battle with a sniper, an assault rifle, a sub machine gun, a light machine gun, or a shotgun with a sidearm of a pistol, launcher, or a melee weapon of any kind, but if like to look good in battle then you could put on attachments to make your gun better and a camo for you and your weapon to make you look stylish. You can also choose what perks you'll have during battle, some examples are faster reload speed, more health, or faster sprint speed, but the perks you can choose from would vary on what Call of Duty game your playing in multiplayer.</p>
